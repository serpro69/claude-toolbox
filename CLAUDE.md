# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a starter template repository providing a complete development environment for Claude Code with pre-configured MCP servers and tools. It is a **configuration-only repository** with no application code.

## Architecture

Two integrated MCP server configurations:

1. **Claude Code** (`.claude/`): Permission allowlist/denylist (`settings.local.json`), skills, agents, and custom commands
2. **Serena** (`.serena/`): Semantic code analysis via LSP — language detection, gitignore integration, tool exclusions (`project.yml`)

For API keys and MCP server setup, see the "MCP Server Configuration" section in `README.md`.

## Claude-Code Behavioral Instructions

### Independent Thinking

When discussing decisions, designs, trade-offs, or approaches:

- **Be direct.** If the user is wrong, say "no, that's wrong" and explain why. Don't soften with "have you considered" when you mean "that won't work."
- **Push back with reasoning.** Challenge assumptions, play devil's advocate, name blind spots. Give genuine opinions — don't default to agreement.
- **Call out patterns.** If the user is spiraling, overthinking, making excuses, or avoiding discomfort, name it directly and explain the cost.
- **Authenticity over contrarianism.** When you genuinely agree, just agree. The goal is honest signal, not reflexive disagreement.
- **Strategic mirror.** Look for what's being underestimated, where reasoning is weak, and where the user is playing small. Give precise, prioritized feedback.

When executing clear, specific tasks (write this function, fix this bug, run these tests): just execute. Save the pushback for decisions that warrant it.

### Exploration Phase

Always explore on your own to gain complete understanding. Only delegate to exploration agents if the user explicitly requests it.
<!-- Why: Claude tends to first spawn exploration agents,
     and then re-reads all the files on its own...
     resulting in double token consumption -->

## Serena Best Practices

Serena provides semantic code analysis — use it efficiently:

### Intelligent Code Reading Strategy

1. **Start with overview**: Use `get_symbols_overview` to see top-level structure
2. **Target specific symbols**: Use `find_symbol` with `include_body=true` only for symbols you need to understand or edit
3. **Pattern search**: Use `search_for_pattern` for flexible regex-based discovery
4. **Reference tracking**: Use `find_referencing_symbols` to understand usage
5. **Read full files only as a last resort** when symbolic tools cannot provide what you need

### Symbol Navigation

Symbols are identified by `name_path` and `relative_path`:

- Top-level: `ClassName` or `function_name`
- Methods: `ClassName/method_name`
- Nested: `OuterClass/InnerClass/method`
- Python constructors: `ClassName/__init__`

### Efficiency Principles

- Read symbol bodies only when you need to understand or edit them
- Use `depth` parameter to get method lists without bodies: `find_symbol("Foo", depth=1, include_body=False)`
- Track which symbols you've read and reuse that context
- Use symbolic tools before reading full files

## Task Tracking

Task tracking uses simple markdown files co-located with feature design docs:

- **Location:** `/docs/wip/[feature]/tasks.md` alongside `design.md` and `implementation.md`
- **Created by:** `analysis-process` skill (Step 6 of the idea workflow)
- **Consumed by:** `implementation-process` skill (reads tasks, updates status/checkboxes during execution)
- **Format:** H2 headings per task, checkbox subtasks, bold key-value status/dependencies

The full workflow: `analysis-process` (design + create tasks) → `implementation-process` (execute tasks) → `testing-process` (verify) → `documentation-process` (document)

## Project Rules

### Permission Configuration

See `.claude/settings.local.json` for the full tool allowlist/denylist.

### Context Management

- Use `/clear` between different tasks to reset context
- This CLAUDE.md is automatically loaded

### Git Integration

- Serena respects `.gitignore` by default
- Use conventional commits: `feat: implement JWT auth`

### Template Sync

- `.github/template-state.json` tracks template version and configuration variables
- Use Actions → Template Sync to pull upstream configuration updates
- Always review PR changes before merging to preserve local customizations
- Sync preserves project-specific values (name, language, prompts) via manifest variables

### Sync Exclusions

- Add `sync_exclusions` array to `.github/template-state.json` to prevent specific paths from being synced
- Patterns use glob syntax (e.g., `.claude/commands/cove/*`)
- See README.md "Configuring Sync Exclusions" section for details

## Testing

Tests for the template-sync feature are in `test/`. Run with:

```bash
for test in test/test-*.sh; do $test; done
```

Tests use shared utilities from `test/helpers.sh`. See that file for available assertions and helpers.

## Troubleshooting

See `README.md` for detailed troubleshooting of MCP connection issues, Serena language detection, and template sync problems.
