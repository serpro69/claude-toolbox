# Batch report

Python 3.9+, standard library only. Run `python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests`.

This change updates the plain report label from Items to Records. Preserve the
count and all calculation behavior. The shipped entry point uses the checked-in
DETAILED_REPORT setting. Historical installations and their settings are not
recorded here. Detailed reporting is an existing optional path; it is not being
activated or redesigned in this increment.
