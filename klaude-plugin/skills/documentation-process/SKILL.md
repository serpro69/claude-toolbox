# Documentation Process

## Conventions

Read capy knowledge base conventions at [capy-knowledge-protocol.md](../_shared/capy-knowledge-protocol.md).

## Guidelines

**Capy search:** Before writing docs, search `kk:arch-decisions` and `kk:project-conventions` for decisions that should be reflected in documentation — decisions not obvious from code alone.

1. After completing a new feature, always see if you need to update the Architecture documentation at `/docs/contributing/ARCHITECTURE.md` and Test documentation in `/docs/contributing/TESTING.md` for other developers, so anyone could easily pick up the work and understand the project and the feature that was added.
2. If the code change included prior decision-making out of several alternatives, document an ADR at `/docs/adr` for any non-trivial/non-obvious decisions that should be preserved.
