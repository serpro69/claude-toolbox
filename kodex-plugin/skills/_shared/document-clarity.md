# Document clarity

Load this entire procedure during the caller's instruction-loading phase, before
subject-matter reads. Apply it to the selected existing artifacts or completed
drafts after the caller has resolved their reader, purpose, destination and scope.
It adds no mandatory linked instructions, profile detection or consumer calls.

## Understand the work

Read each complete selected artifact and the relevant requirements, decisions,
implementation and tests behind its claims. A document repeating an assertion does
not verify it. Inspect supplied sources when needed to explain the behavior,
conditions and rationale at the applicable revision. Follow relevant references
far enough to understand the claim, without recursively auditing the whole feature.
Reading a source does not authorize editing it or executing its commands.

Requirements establish intent; implementation establishes current behavior. Tests
provide evidence of exercised cases, not proof of intent or complete coverage.
Distinguish accepted requirements, proposals, implemented behavior and future work.
When no implementation exists, explain the planned contract as planned. Do not
invent runtime evidence. Reuse source understanding from the invoking session only
after checking that its scope and revision still apply; inspect missing or changed
context instead of repeating unrelated investigation.

Investigate accessible references before asking for missing context. If a
consequential gap remains, ask a focused question or preserve an explicit limitation
in the affected artifact. Record the unresolved issue, concrete next step and known
owner there or in an already-selected task document; say when the owner is unknown.
Do not manufacture an answer, silently settle a product decision or create an extra
report to hide the gap. Continue independent, supported edits when possible.

## Establish protected meaning

Keep a working inventory of essential claims and their evidence; no separate ledger
is required. Preserve:

- Requirements, observable behavior, rationale, constraints and uncertainty.
- Mandatory versus optional language; conditions, exceptions and thresholds.
- Identifiers, interface shapes, ownership and decision provenance.
- Deployment gates, completion status, verification limits and unresolved decisions.
- Required document sections, domain-rubric topics, task checkboxes and dependencies.

Conclusive evidence can justify correcting a factual documentation error. A conflict
between accepted requirements and implementation must stay explicit: describe both
and the next action needed to reconcile them. Neither source automatically overrides
the other. Do not erase a requirement to make the prose agree with the code.

Respect the destination's stated audience and restrictions. Source access for
understanding does not grant permission to disclose its facts or references. Keep
restricted material within its authorized audience; when disclosure is uncertain,
retain the limitation or ask before including it. Removing a citation alone does
not authorize sharing the underlying fact.

## Edit for the reader

Lead with purpose and the applicable current or planned behavior. Help the reader
answer, where relevant to the artifact:

1. Why does this work exist?
2. What happens in a representative case?
3. What changes in the current increment?
4. What remains outside it?
5. What still needs a decision?

Use a concrete scenario when it resolves confusion and the evidence supports every
part of it. Introduce unfamiliar terms at first use. Explain causes and consequences
before storage fields or verification history; place technical reference detail
after orientation. Remove duplication while retaining the detail needed for the
reader's task. Preserve the project's organization and document-type requirements;
do not force every artifact into one template or invent answers to irrelevant
questions. An explicit unknown can be the correct answer.

Reorganize within the selected scope. Preserve existing anchors or update affected
in-scope links, including cross-file references. Check accessible inbound references
when changing headings; keep the anchor when callers outside scope would break, or
surface the wider change needed. Keep executable examples intact unless an
authorized, evidence-backed correction is verified. Do not change implementation,
run deployments or migrations, or make production or external writes.

When the baseline already satisfies comprehension, correctness, fidelity, visibility
and structural requirements, leave it unchanged. Clear prose may still need a
factual or disclosure repair; passing the five reader questions alone is not a
reason to retain such a defect. Make only justified changes, without a word-count
reduction target or a new summary artifact.

## Verify separately

Compare the revision with the original, requirements and inspected source evidence.
Check comprehension first: can the intended reader answer the applicable questions
through the artifact's intended reading path, without relying on the editor's hidden
context? Check the specific confusion motivating the edit, not just sentence length.

Then check fidelity independently against the protected-meaning inventory. No
qualification may disappear and no unsupported claim may appear. Recheck headings,
anchors, links, task state, required topics and executable examples affected by the
edit. Correct editorial regressions; keep unresolved source disagreements visible
with their next step. Fluent prose cannot compensate for lost meaning.

Report changed paths, whether the result was unchanged, and material evidence gaps
or wider edits needed. This is an in-session comparison, not independent fidelity
verification or proof of improved human comprehension. The caller owns any further
review required by the project.
