# claude-toolbox

[![Mentioned in Awesome Claude Code](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code)

claude-toolbox is a collection of "tools" for all your agentic workflows (**currently supports claude-code and codex!**) — pre-configured MCP servers, skills, sub-agents, commands, hooks, statuslines with themes, and more - everything you need for AI-powered development workflows, used and battle-tested daily on many of my own projects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project was created with the help of Claude-Code. Is it, however, always reviewed, tested, and reworked with a human-in-the-loop.
>
> No AI slop here. Purely AI-made skills are hot garbage, and that's putting it mildly.
>
> That said, if you have any problems with code that is written by AI - you've been warned. But, then again, why would you be interested in AI-related configs and skills in the first place... `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Why claude-toolbox?

Tools like Claude Code and Codex are powerful on their own, but LLMs don't know your development workflow. This project started as a way for me to streamline claude configurations across all my projects without needing to copy-paste things. With time, patterns and re-curring prompts evolved into skills and agents. Currently, claude-toolbox gives you two things:

**A minimal, opinionated Claude Code and Codex configuration** — sensible permission baselines, a rich statusline, Serena LSP integration, MCP server wiring, and sync infrastructure to keep it all up to date across your projects. Think of it as a dotfiles repo for Claude Code and Codex.

**A structured development pipeline** — 10 workflow skills with explicit multi-language support that take you from idea through design, implementation, code review, testing, to documentation, with persistent knowledge that carries across sessions.

```
/design → /review-design → /implement → /review-code → /test → /document
```

Out of the box you get:

- **10 workflow skills** — a complete development pipeline invoked as `/kk:<skill-name>`, with many skills integrated with each other.
- **Multi-language support** — precise and distinct instructions from design, to implementation, to testing, to review for: go, java, js/ts, kotlin, kubernetes, and python
- **Multi-model code review** — independent reviewers using sub-agents and external models (Gemini, etc.)
- **Semantic code analysis** — LSP-powered symbol navigation and reference tracking via Serena
- **Persistent knowledge base** — findings, decisions, and conventions that survive across sessions via Capy
- **Up-to-date library docs** — always-current documentation lookup via Context7
- **Battle-tested configuration** — permissions, statusline themes, hooks, sensible defaults

## Choose Your Path

**Starting a new project?** Use the template — you get the full configuration and plugin pre-wired, plus sync infrastructure to pull future updates.
→ [Template Setup](#template-setup)

**Existing project, want the full setup?** Adopt the configuration, plugin, and sync infrastructure without creating from the template.
→ [Adopting into Existing Repositories](#adopting-into-existing-repositories)

**Just want the skills?** Install the kk plugin — no template needed.
→ [Plugin-Only Setup](#plugin-only-setup)

## Providers

claude-toolbox supports two AI coding providers:

|                             | Claude Code                         | Codex (OpenAI)                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Skills**                  | `klaude-plugin/` (authored)         | `kodex-plugin/` (generated)                            |
| **Sub-agents**              | `klaude-plugin/agents/*.md`         | `.codex/agents/*.toml` (generated)                     |
| **Project instructions**    | `CLAUDE.md`                         | `AGENTS.md`                                            |
| **Behavioral instructions** | `.claude/CLAUDE.extra.md`           | `.codex/scripts/session-start.sh`                      |
| **Config**                  | `.claude/settings.json`             | `.codex/config.toml`                                   |
| **Hooks**                   | `klaude-plugin/hooks/`              | `.codex/hooks.json`                                    |
| **Rules/Permissions**       | `.claude/settings.json`             | `.codex/rules/default.rules` (Starlark)                |
| **Plugin install**          | `/plugin install kk@claude-toolbox` | `codex plugin marketplace add serpro69/claude-toolbox` |
| **Template sync**           | Full support                        | `.codex/` synced                                       |

`klaude-plugin/` is the canonical source of truth. The `generate-kodex` tool produces `kodex-plugin/` and `.codex/agents/` with all necessary transformations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Codex known limitations:**
> - **Plugin-only installs** provide skills and profile content only — hooks, sub-agents, rules, and project config require [template setup](#template-setup) or [adopting into an existing repo](#adopting-into-existing-repositories).
> - **PreToolUse hooks** are only wired for Bash commands. `apply_patch` and MCP tool hooks are documented in [ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-codex-hook-enforcement-gap.md) but not yet implemented.
> - **MCP servers** (Context7, Serena, Pal) must be configured at the user level — they are not packaged in the plugin. See [Codex MCP Setup](#codex-mcp-setup).

## Requirements

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — the AI coding assistant this toolbox extends
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)** — used by some MCP server installations
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — Python package runner for Serena and Pal MCP servers
- **[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)** — JSON processor, required for template-cleanup

### API Keys

- [Context7](https://context7.com/) API key — for library documentation lookups
- Gemini API key for [Pal](https://github.com/serpro69/pal-mcp-server) (or [any other provider](https://github.com/serpro69/pal-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md)) — for multi-model code review

### MCP Server Configuration

MCP servers are configured at the user level (not in the repo) to keep API keys safe. These configs are generic enough to reuse across all your projects.

You don't need all servers to get started. Add them incrementally:

1. **Serena** (no API key needed) — semantic code analysis via LSP. Works immediately after setup.
2. **Context7** (needs API key) — up-to-date library documentation and code examples.
3. **Pal** (needs API key) — multi-model AI integration for code review, debugging, planning, and security audit.
4. [**Capy**](https://github.com/serpro69/capy) (optional, auto-configured by bootstrap) — persistent knowledge base across sessions. Install with `brew install serpro69/tap/capy`.

#### Claude Code

> [!NOTE]
> Add MCP servers to `~/.claude.json` under the `mcpServers` key.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using my [claude-in-docker](https://github.com/serpro69/claude-in-docker) images, consider replacing `npx` and `uvx` calls with direct tool invocations. The images come shipped with all of the above MCP tools pre-installed, and you will avoid downloading dependencies every time you launch claude cli.

#### Codex MCP Setup

> [!NOTE]
> MCP servers are added via `codex mcp add` and stored in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
> Capy is already configured at the project level in `.codex/config.toml` — no user setup needed.

```bash
# Context7 — streamable HTTP, no API key env var needed (key is in the URL header)
codex mcp add context7 --url "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"

# Serena — stdio server via uvx
codex mcp add serena -- uvx --from "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena" serena start-mcp-server --context ide-assistant --project .

# Pal — stdio server via uvx, with env vars for model config
codex mcp add pal \
  --env "PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$HOME/.local/bin" \
  --env "DEFAULT_MODEL=auto" \
  --env "DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP=high" \
  --env "GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" \
  --env "GOOGLE_ALLOWED_MODELS=gemini-3.1-pro-preview,gemini-3-flash-preview" \
  -- sh -c "$HOME/.local/bin/uvx --from git+https://github.com/serpro69/pal-mcp-server.git pal-mcp-server"
```

Or manually add to your `~/.codex/config.toml` file:


<details>
<summary>Example <code>mcpServers</code> configuration</summary>

```toml
[mcp_servers.context7]
url = "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
http_headers = { "CONTEXT7_API_KEY" = "YOUR_CONTEXT7_API_KEY" }

[mcp_servers.serena]
command = "uvx"
args = ["--from", "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena", "serena", "start-mcp-server", "--context", "ide-assistant", "--project", "."]

[mcp_servers.pal]
command = "sh"
args = ["-c", "$HOME/.local/bin/uvx --from git+https://github.com/serpro69/pal-mcp-server.git pal-mcp-server"]

[mcp_servers.pal.env]
DEFAULT_MODEL = "auto"
DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP = "high"
GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
GOOGLE_ALLOWED_MODELS = "gemini-3.1-pro-preview,gemini-3-flash-preview"
PATH = "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/home/sergio/.local/bin"
```

</details>

Verify with `codex mcp list`. See [Pal configuration docs](https://github.com/serpro69/pal-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/configuration.md) for model and thinking mode options.

## Template Setup

1. [Create a new project from this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=claude-toolbox&template_owner=serpro69) using the **Use this template** button.

2. Initialize the template — choose one method:

   **Option A: GitHub Actions** (recommended)

   Go to your new repo's **Actions** tab → **Template Cleanup** → **Run workflow**. Provide:
   - `LANGUAGES` (required) — programming languages, comma-separated (e.g., `python`, `python,typescript`).
     See [supported languages](https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#programming-language-support--semantic-analysis-capabilities).
   - `SERENA_INITIAL_PROMPT` — initial prompt given to the LLM on project activation
   - Other inputs are optional with sensible defaults.

> [!TIP]
> Take a look at serena [project.yaml](./.serena/project.yml) configuration file for more details.

**Option B: Run locally**

```bash
./.github/scripts/template-cleanup.sh
```

Interactive mode walks you through each option. Run with `--help` for all flags, or pass them directly:

```bash
./.github/scripts/template-cleanup.sh --languages python,typescript -y
```

3. Clone your repo (if using Option A) and verify MCP servers:

   ```
   > /mcp
   ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
   │ Manage MCP servers                                                 │
   │                                                                    │
   │ ❯ 1. context7                  ✔ connected · Enter to view details │
   │   2. serena                    ✔ connected · Enter to view details │
   │   3. pal                       ✔ connected · Enter to view details │
   ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
   ```

   The kk plugin (skills, commands, hooks) is available via the claude-toolbox marketplace configured in `.claude/settings.json`.

4. Finalize initialization:

   ```bash
   chmod +x .github/scripts/bootstrap.sh && ./.github/scripts/bootstrap.sh
   ```

   This installs the kk plugin, wires up the Capy knowledge base (if installed), and commits the configuration.

5. **Recommended:** Run `/config` in Claude Code and disable **Auto-compact**. This prevents Claude from compacting context mid-task, which degrades quality significantly. See [Recommended Settings](#recommended-settings) for the full config.

6. [Try it out!](#try-it)

## Plugin-Only Setup

Already have a project? Install just the plugin to get all 10 workflow skills.

#### Claude Code

```
/plugin install kk@claude-toolbox
```

Skills are available as `/kk:(skill-name)` (annotated with `(kk)` in the slash command menu). The Claude plugin also includes commands, hooks (Bash validation), and sub-agents. See the [kk plugin documentation](./klaude-plugin/README.md) for details.

> [!TIP]
> Want the full configuration too (settings, statusline, Serena, sync infrastructure)? See [Adopting into Existing Repositories](#adopting-into-existing-repositories).
> For MCP servers, see [MCP Server Configuration](#mcp-server-configuration).

#### Codex

```
codex plugin marketplace add serpro69/claude-toolbox
```

The Codex plugin includes skills and language-specific profile content (review checklists, implementation gotchas, etc.). See [kodex-plugin](./kodex-plugin/README.md) for details.

> [!NOTE]
> The Codex plugin provides **skills and profiles only** — it does not include hooks, sub-agents, Starlark rules, or project configuration. For the full Codex experience (SessionStart/PreToolUse hooks, sub-agents, config, rules), use the [template setup](#template-setup) or [adopt into an existing repo](#adopting-into-existing-repositories).

For MCP servers (Serena, Context7, Pal), see [Codex MCP Setup](#codex-mcp-setup).

## Try It

After setup, try the core workflow:

1. **Start with an idea.** Type `/kk:design` and describe a feature you want to build. Claude will ask you refinement questions one at a time, then produce design docs and a task list in `docs/wip/`.

2. **Review the design.** Run `/kk:review-design your-feature` to catch gaps before writing code.

3. **Build it.** Type `/kk:implement` — Claude executes the task list with code review checkpoints between batches.

4. **Review the code.** `/kk:review-code` checks for SOLID violations, security risks, and quality issues. Use `/kk:review-code:isolated` for independent sub-agent reviewers with zero authorship bias.

This is the core loop. See the [kk plugin README](./klaude-plugin/README.md) for all available skills and the full workflow pipeline.

## What's Included

### MCP Servers

Four servers provide complementary capabilities:

| Server                                                | Purpose                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Context7](https://context7.com/)**                 | Up-to-date library documentation and code examples                                     |
| **[Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena)**        | Semantic code analysis via LSP — symbol navigation, reference tracking, targeted reads |
| **[Pal](https://github.com/serpro69/pal-mcp-server)** | Multi-model AI integration — chat, debugging, code review, planning, security audit    |
| **[Capy](https://github.com/serpro69/capy)**          | Persistent knowledge base — cross-session project memory with FTS5 search              |

### Knowledge Base (Capy)

Skills are **knowledge-aware** via [Capy](https://github.com/serpro69/capy). They search for relevant context before executing (architecture decisions, review findings, language idioms) and index valuable learnings after producing output. Knowledge persists across sessions per-project using an FTS5 full-text search index.

Without Capy, each session starts fresh — all skills still work, they just don't carry learnings forward. Install when you want cross-session memory.

**Installation:** `brew install serpro69/tap/capy` then run `capy setup` in your project directory. The bootstrap script sets up Capy automatically if the binary is on PATH.

### kk Plugin ([`klaude-plugin/`](./klaude-plugin/README.md))

The **kk** plugin contains all development workflow functionality — 10 skills, 4 commands, and hooks — distributed via the Claude Code plugin system (see [kodex-plugin](./kodex-plugin/README.md) for the Codex variant). Skills are invoked as `/kk:skill-name`, commands as `/kk:dir:command`.

Includes: **design**, **implement**, **test**, **document**, **development-guidelines**, **review-code**, **review-spec**, **review-design**, **merge-docs**, **chain-of-verification**. Plus commands for CoVe, implementation review, design review, Task Master migration, and sync workflow updates. See the [plugin README](./klaude-plugin/README.md) for full details.

Alongside `skills/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, and `hooks/`, the plugin ships a top-level `profiles/` directory. Each profile (e.g., `go`, `python`, `k8s`) bundles per-domain content — detection rules, review checklists, design prompts, test validators, doc rubrics — that the workflow skills consult when the code under work matches the profile. Profiles are the extension point for new languages and IaC DSLs; see the **Profile Conventions** section of [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for the full authoring contract.

### Configuration

- **Permission allowlist/denylist** (`.claude/settings.json`) — baseline permissions: auto-approves safe bash commands and WebSearch while blocking dangerous patterns. Per-repo MCP tool permissions go in `settings.local.json`.
- **Status line** (`.claude/scripts/statusline_enhanced.sh`) — rich statusline with model, context %, git branch, session duration, thinking mode, and rate limits. Themes: set `CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_THEME` to `darcula`, `nord`, or `catppuccin`, and `CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_MODE` to `dark` (default) or `light` to match your terminal background
- **Serena config** (`.serena/project.yml`) — language detection, gitignore integration, encoding settings

### Template Infrastructure

- **template-cleanup** — GitHub Action or local CLI script to initialize a new repo from this template
- **template-sync** workflow — pull upstream configuration updates into your project via PR
- **Sync exclusions** — prevent specific files from being re-added during sync
- **Test suite** — tests across 8 suites covering plugin structure, codex structure, sync/cleanup infrastructure

## Recommended Settings

> [!TIP]
> Configure via `claude /config`. The config file is usually at `~/.claude.json`.

This is my current config, tweaked for best results. **I can't recommend enough disabling auto-compact** — I've seen many a time claude starting to compact conversations in the middle of a task, which produces very poor results for the remaining work it does after compacting.

## Receiving Template Updates

Repos created from this template can pull configuration updates via the **Template Sync** workflow.

### How Configuration Works

> [!NOTE]
> Claude Code settings are split between two project-scoped files:
>
> - **`.claude/settings.json`** — upstream-managed defaults, synced from this template (permissions baseline, env vars, model, plugins, statusline)
> - **`.claude/settings.local.json`** — your per-repo overrides, never synced (hooks, MCP server enables, additional permissions, personal preferences)
>
> You can edit `settings.json` directly if you like, they will be intelligently merged with this repo's settings, but the general advice is to place your customizations in `settings.local.json`. As an added bonus, "Don't ask again" grant prompts in claude-code sessions land in local settings automatically (as of v2.1.92).

### Prerequisites

- `.github/template-state.json` must exist (created automatically for new repos, or [manually for older ones](#migration-for-existing-repositories))
- Allow actions to create pull-requests: repo **Settings** → **Actions**
  <img width="792" height="376" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81343169-fa87-4631-ad5d-60fde7685538" />

### Using Template Sync

1. Go to **Actions** → **Template Sync** → **Run workflow**
2. Choose a version: `latest` (default), `master`, or a specific tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
3. Optionally enable **dry_run** to preview changes without creating a PR
4. Review and merge the created PR
5. Merge to apply updates

### What Gets Synced

**Updated:** `.claude/` (settings, CLAUDE.extra.md, statusline scripts), `.codex/` (config.toml, hooks, rules, scripts, agents), `.serena/`, and the sync infrastructure itself (see [Syncing Workflow Files](#syncing-workflow-files) for permission requirements). Skills, commands, and hooks are managed by the plugin system — not template sync.

**Preserved:** Project-specific values (name, language, prompts), `settings.local.json`, gitignored files

**settings.json merge behavior:** The sync uses smart-merge semantics — your downstream `settings.json` is "master" and upstream fills gaps:

- **New keys** from upstream are added (e.g., new deny patterns, new env vars)
- **Existing values** are never overwritten (your customizations are preserved)
- **Arrays** are concatenated with deduplication (e.g., new upstream deny rules are appended)
- **Manifest variables** (`CC_MODEL`, `CC_EFFORT_LEVEL`, etc.) still override after the merge — these are your explicit choices

### Sync Exclusions

If you've removed template files you don't need, prevent sync from re-adding them:

Edit `.github/template-state.json` and add a `sync_exclusions` array:

```diff
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "upstream_repo": "serpro69/claude-toolbox",
  "template_version": "v0.2.0",
  "synced_at": "2025-01-27T10:00:00Z",
+ "sync_exclusions": [
+   ".claude/CLAUDE.extra.md",
+   ".claude/settings.json"
+ ],
  "variables": { "..." : "..." }
}
```

**Pattern syntax:**

- Patterns use glob syntax where `*` matches any characters including directory separators
- Patterns are matched against project-relative paths (e.g., `.claude/settings.json`)
- Common patterns: `.claude/CLAUDE.extra.md` (single file), `.serena/*` (entire directory)

**Behavior:**

- Excluded files are NOT added if they exist upstream but not locally
- Excluded files are NOT updated if they exist in both places
- Excluded files are NOT flagged as deleted if they exist locally but not upstream
- Excluded files appear as "Excluded" in the sync report for transparency

### Syncing Workflow Files

Template sync updates its own workflow and script (`.github/workflows/template-sync.yml` and `.github/scripts/template-sync.sh`) alongside everything else. However, GitHub does not allow the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` to push changes to workflow files — the push is rejected with a `workflows` permission error ([details](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/issues/3558)).

These updates are sometimes required for sync to work correctly (e.g., when the sync logic itself changes between versions), so skipping them indefinitely is not recommended.

**Option A: Update manually before running sync**

Update the sync files locally, commit, push, then run the workflow:

```bash
VERSION="v0.12.0"  # use the version you want to sync to
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serpro69/claude-toolbox/${VERSION}/.github/workflows/template-sync.yml" \
  -o .github/workflows/template-sync.yml
```

Or use the `/kk:sync-workflow:sync-workflow latest` command in Claude Code.

**Option B: Set up a GitHub App for automatic sync**

A GitHub App token has the `workflows` permission that `GITHUB_TOKEN` lacks. Once configured, the sync workflow handles everything automatically — no manual steps needed.

1. **Create a GitHub App** ([guide](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#authenticating-with-github-app-generated-tokens)) with these repository permissions:
   - **Contents:** Read & Write
   - **Pull requests:** Read & Write
   - **Workflows:** Read & Write

2. **Install the app** on the repository (or repositories) where you run template sync.

3. **Generate a private key** for the app (Settings → Private keys → Generate).

4. **Configure your repository:**
   - Add a **repository variable** named `CLAUDE_TOOLBOX_APP_ID` with the app's numeric ID
   - Add a **repository secret** named `CLAUDE_TOOLBOX_APP_KEY` with the app's private key (PEM contents)

   Go to repo **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** to add both.

The workflow detects these credentials automatically and uses them for both pushing the branch and creating the PR.

### Migrating from Task Master

Task Master MCP was removed in favor of native markdown-based task tracking integrated into the `design` and `implement` skills.

The easiest way to migrate is to run the migration command in Claude Code:

```
/kk:migrate-from-taskmaster:migrate
```

It will port pending tasks, clean up TM files, update configs, and walk you through each step with confirmation prompts.

<details>
<summary>Manual migration steps</summary>

If you prefer to migrate manually, follow these steps after syncing:

1. **Port any pending tasks** to the new format: create `/docs/wip/[feature]/tasks.md` files following the [example task file](./klaude-plugin/skills/design/example-tasks.md). Completed tasks don't need porting.

1. **Remove Task Master files and config:**

   ```bash
   rm -rf .taskmaster
   rm -rf .claude/commands/tm
   rm -f .claude/TM_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md
   rm -f .claude/agents/task-orchestrator.md
   rm -f .claude/agents/task-executor.md
   rm -f .claude/agents/task-checker.md
   ```

1. **Remove Task Master from `~/.claude.json`:** delete the `task-master-ai` entry from your `mcpServers` config.

1. **Remove TM variables from `.github/template-state.json`:** delete `TM_CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `TM_APPEND_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and `TM_PERMISSION_MODE` from the `variables` object.

1. **Remove TM references from `CLAUDE.md`:** delete the "Task Master Integration" and "Task Master AI Instructions" sections (including the `@./.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md` import).

1. **Update the template-sync workflow** ([why?](https://github.com/serpro69/claude-toolbox/issues/17)): the old workflow contains taskmaster-specific sync logic that will break future syncs. Run `/kk:sync-workflow:sync-workflow latest` or manually replace both files:

   ```bash
   VERSION="v0.3.0"  # or use latest tag
   curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serpro69/claude-toolbox/${VERSION}/.github/workflows/template-sync.yml" \
     -o .github/workflows/template-sync.yml
   curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serpro69/claude-toolbox/${VERSION}/.github/scripts/template-sync.sh" \
     -o .github/scripts/template-sync.sh
   chmod +x .github/scripts/template-sync.sh
   ```

Task tracking now lives in simple markdown files (`/docs/wip/[feature]/tasks.md`) created by the `design` skill and consumed by `implement`. No external MCP server required.

</details>

### Upgrading to the Plugin System (v0.5.0+)

Skills and commands have moved from the template to the **kk** plugin:

- Skills remain unprefixed: `/design` (annotated with `(kk)` in the menu)
- Commands are now namespaced: `/project:chain-of-verification` → `/kk:chain-of-verification:default`
- The template-sync workflow handles migration automatically on next sync
- After merging the sync PR, run `/plugin install kk@claude-toolbox`

### Adopting into Existing Repositories

You don't need to create a repo from this template to use the full configuration and sync infrastructure. Any existing repo can adopt it:

1. **Install the kk plugin** to get all skills, commands, and hooks:

   ```
   /plugin install kk@claude-toolbox
   ```

2. **Set up sync infrastructure.** Create `.github/template-state.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "schema_version": "1",
     "upstream_repo": "serpro69/claude-toolbox",
     "template_version": "v1.0.0",
     "synced_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
     "variables": {
       "PROJECT_NAME": "my-cool-project",
       "LANGUAGES": "go",
       "CC_MODEL": "default",
       "CC_EFFORT_LEVEL": "high",
       "CC_PERMISSION_MODE": "default",
       "CC_STATUSLINE": "enhanced",
       "SERENA_INITIAL_PROMPT": "",
       "CODEX_MODEL": "gpt-5.5",
       "CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY": "on-request",
       "SKIP_CAPY": "false"
     }
   }
   ```

   Copy `.github/workflows/template-sync.yml` and `.github/scripts/template-sync.sh` from the [template repository](https://github.com/serpro69/claude-toolbox).

3. **Run Template Sync** from your repo's Actions tab to pull in the configuration (settings, Serena config, statusline, permissions). Review and merge the PR.

> [!TIP]
> Step 1 works standalone if you only want the skills. Steps 2-3 add the opinionated configuration and keep it in sync with upstream improvements.

## Development

### Running Tests

Tests across 8 suites cover plugin structure, codex configuration, and template sync/cleanup infrastructure:
