# claude-toolbox

[![Mentioned in Awesome Claude Code](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code)

claude-toolbox is a collection of "tools" for all your Claude Code workflows — pre-configured MCP servers, skills, sub-agents, commands, hooks, statuslines with themes, and more - everything you need for AI-powered development workflows, used and battle-tested daily on many of my own projects.

<img width="3440" height="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27ef7269-0153-47c0-b07d-ed6a9504a176" />

## Why claude-toolbox?

Claude Code is powerful on its own, but it doesn't know your development workflow. This project started as a way for me to streamline claude configurations across all my projects without needing to copy-paste things. With time, patterns and re-curring prompts evolved into skills and agents. Currently, claude-toolbox gives you two things:

**A minimal, opinionated Claude Code configuration** — sensible permission baselines, a rich statusline, Serena LSP integration, MCP server wiring, and sync infrastructure to keep it all up to date across your projects. Think of it as a dotfiles repo for Claude Code.

**A structured development pipeline** — 10 workflow skills that take you from idea through design, implementation, code review, testing, to documentation, with persistent knowledge that carries across sessions.

```
/plan → /review-design → /implement → /review-code → /test → /document
```

Out of the box you get:

- **10 workflow skills** — a complete development pipeline invoked as `/skill-name`
- **Multi-model code review** — independent reviewers using sub-agents and external models (Gemini, etc.)
- **Semantic code analysis** — LSP-powered symbol navigation and reference tracking via Serena
- **Persistent knowledge base** — findings, decisions, and conventions that survive across sessions via Capy
- **Up-to-date library docs** — always-current documentation lookup via Context7
- **Battle-tested configuration** — permissions, statusline themes, hooks, sensible defaults

## Choose Your Path

**Starting a new project?** Use the template — you get the full configuration and plugin pre-wired, plus sync infrastructure to pull future updates.
→ [Template Setup](#template-setup)

**Existing project, want the full setup?** Adopt the configuration, plugin, and sync infrastructure without creating from the template.
→ [Adopting into Existing Repositories](#adopting-into-existing-repositories)

**Just want the skills?** Install the kk plugin — all 10 skills, commands, and hooks in one command. No template needed.
→ [Plugin-Only Setup](#plugin-only-setup)

## Requirements

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — the AI coding assistant this toolbox extends
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)** — used by some MCP server installations
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — Python package runner for Serena and Pal MCP servers
- **[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)** — JSON processor, required for template-cleanup

### API Keys

- [Context7](https://context7.com/) API key — for library documentation lookups
- Gemini API key for [Pal](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server) (or [any other provider](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md)) — for multi-model code review

### MCP Server Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> MCP servers must be configured in `~/.claude.json` (not in the repo) to keep API keys safe.
> These configs are generic enough to reuse across all your projects.

You don't need all servers to get started. Add them incrementally:

1. **Serena** (no API key needed) — semantic code analysis via LSP. Works immediately after setup.
2. **Context7** (needs API key) — up-to-date library documentation and code examples.
3. **Pal** (needs API key) — multi-model AI integration for code review, debugging, planning, and security audit.
4. [**Capy**](https://github.com/serpro69/capy) (optional, auto-configured by bootstrap) — persistent knowledge base across sessions. Install with `brew install serpro69/tap/capy`.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using my [claude-in-docker](https://github.com/serpro69/claude-in-docker) images, consider replacing `npx` and `uvx` calls with direct tool invocations. The images come shipped with all of the above MCP tools pre-installed, and you will avoid downloading dependencies every time you launch claude cli.

## Template Setup

1. [Create a new project from this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=claude-toolbox&template_owner=serpro69) using the **Use this template** button.

2. Initialize the template — choose one method:

   **Option A: GitHub Actions** (recommended)

   Go to your new repo's **Actions** tab → **Template Cleanup** → **Run workflow**. Provide:
   - `LANGUAGES` (required) — programming languages, comma-separated (e.g., `python`, `python,typescript`).
     See [supported languages](https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#programming-language-support--semantic-analysis-capabilities).
   - `SERENA_INITIAL_PROMPT` — initial prompt given to the LLM on project activation
   - Other inputs are optional with sensible defaults.

> [!TIP]
> Take a look at serena [project.yaml](./.serena/project.yml) configuration file for more details.

   **Option B: Run locally**

   ```bash
   ./.github/scripts/template-cleanup.sh
   ```

   Interactive mode walks you through each option. Run with `--help` for all flags, or pass them directly:

   ```bash
   ./.github/scripts/template-cleanup.sh --languages python,typescript -y
   ```

3. Clone your repo (if using Option A) and verify MCP servers:

   ```
   > /mcp
   ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
   │ Manage MCP servers                                                 │
   │                                                                    │
   │ ❯ 1. context7                  ✔ connected · Enter to view details │
   │   2. serena                    ✔ connected · Enter to view details │
   │   3. pal                       ✔ connected · Enter to view details │
   ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
   ```

   The kk plugin (skills, commands, hooks) is available via the claude-toolbox marketplace configured in `.claude/settings.json`.

4. Finalize initialization:

   ```bash
   chmod +x .github/scripts/bootstrap.sh && ./.github/scripts/bootstrap.sh
   ```

   This installs the kk plugin, wires up the Capy knowledge base (if installed), and commits the configuration.

5. **Recommended:** Run `/config` in Claude Code and disable **Auto-compact**. This prevents Claude from compacting context mid-task, which degrades quality significantly. See [Recommended Settings](#recommended-settings) for the full config.

6. [Try it out!](#try-it)

## Plugin-Only Setup

Already have a project? Install just the kk plugin to get all skills, commands, and hooks:

```
/plugin install kk@claude-toolbox
```

That's it. All 10 skills are now available as `/skill-name` (annotated with `(kk)` in the slash command menu). See the [kk plugin documentation](./klaude-plugin/README.md) for details.

> [!TIP]
> Want the full configuration too (settings, statusline, Serena, sync infrastructure)? See [Adopting into Existing Repositories](#adopting-into-existing-repositories).
> For MCP servers, see [MCP Server Configuration](#mcp-server-configuration) and add the configs you want to `~/.claude.json`.

## Try It

After setup, try the core workflow:

1. **Start with an idea.** Type `/plan` and describe a feature you want to build. Claude will ask you refinement questions one at a time, then produce design docs and a task list in `docs/wip/`.

2. **Review the design.** Run `/review-design your-feature` to catch gaps before writing code.

3. **Build it.** Type `/implement` — Claude executes the task list with code review checkpoints between batches.

4. **Review the code.** `/review-code` checks for SOLID violations, security risks, and quality issues. Use `/review-code:isolated` for independent sub-agent reviewers with zero authorship bias.

This is the core loop. See the [kk plugin README](./klaude-plugin/README.md) for all available skills and the full workflow pipeline.

## What's Included

### MCP Servers

Four servers provide complementary capabilities:

| Server                                                          | Purpose                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Context7](https://context7.com/)**                           | Up-to-date library documentation and code examples                                     |
| **[Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena)**                  | Semantic code analysis via LSP — symbol navigation, reference tracking, targeted reads |
| **[Pal](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server)** | Multi-model AI integration — chat, debugging, code review, planning, security audit    |
| **[Capy](https://github.com/serpro69/capy)**                    | Persistent knowledge base — cross-session project memory with FTS5 search              |

### Knowledge Base (Capy)

Skills are **knowledge-aware** via [Capy](https://github.com/serpro69/capy). They search for relevant context before executing (architecture decisions, review findings, language idioms) and index valuable learnings after producing output. Knowledge persists across sessions per-project using an FTS5 full-text search index.

Without Capy, each session starts fresh — all skills still work, they just don't carry learnings forward. Install when you want cross-session memory.

**Installation:** `brew install serpro69/tap/capy` then run `capy setup` in your project directory. The bootstrap script sets up Capy automatically if the binary is on PATH.

### kk Plugin ([`klaude-plugin/`](./klaude-plugin/README.md))

The **kk** plugin contains all development workflow functionality — 10 skills, 4 commands, and hooks — distributed via the Claude Code plugin system. Skills are invoked as `/skill-name`, commands as `/kk:dir:command`.

Includes: **plan**, **implement**, **test**, **document**, **development-guidelines**, **review-code**, **review-spec**, **review-design**, **merge-docs**, **chain-of-verification**. Plus commands for CoVe, implementation review, design review, Task Master migration, and sync workflow updates. See the [plugin README](./klaude-plugin/README.md) for full details.

### Configuration

- **Permission allowlist/denylist** (`.claude/settings.json`) — baseline permissions: auto-approves safe bash commands and WebSearch while blocking dangerous patterns. Per-repo MCP tool permissions go in `settings.local.json`.
- **Status line** (`.claude/scripts/statusline_enhanced.sh`) — rich statusline with model, context %, git branch, session duration, thinking mode, and rate limits. Themes: set `CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_THEME` to `darcula`, `nord`, or `catppuccin`, and `CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_MODE` to `dark` (default) or `light` to match your terminal background
- **Serena config** (`.serena/project.yml`) — language detection, gitignore integration, encoding settings

### Template Infrastructure

- **template-cleanup** — GitHub Action or local CLI script to initialize a new repo from this template
- **template-sync** workflow — pull upstream configuration updates into your project via PR
- **Sync exclusions** — prevent specific files from being re-added during sync
- **Test suite** — 157 tests across 5 suites covering the plugin structure, sync/cleanup infrastructure

## Recommended Settings

> [!TIP]
> Configure via `claude /config`. The config file is usually at `~/.claude.json`.

This is my current config, tweaked for best results. **I can't recommend enough disabling auto-compact** — I've seen many a time claude starting to compact conversations in the middle of a task, which produces very poor results for the remaining work it does after compacting.

## Receiving Template Updates

Repos created from this template can pull configuration updates via the **Template Sync** workflow.

### How Configuration Works

> [!NOTE]
> Claude Code settings are split between two project-scoped files:
> - **`.claude/settings.json`** — upstream-managed defaults, synced from this template (permissions baseline, env vars, model, plugins, statusline)
> - **`.claude/settings.local.json`** — your per-repo overrides, never synced (hooks, MCP server enables, additional permissions, personal preferences)
>
> You can edit `settings.json` directly if you like, they will be intelligently merged with this repo's settings, but the general advice is to place your customizations in `settings.local.json`. As an added bonus, "Don't ask again" grant prompts in claude-code sessions land in local settings automatically (as of v2.1.92).

### Prerequisites

- `.github/template-state.json` must exist (created automatically for new repos, or [manually for older ones](#migration-for-existing-repositories))
- Allow actions to create pull-requests: repo **Settings** → **Actions**
  <img width="792" height="376" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81343169-fa87-4631-ad5d-60fde7685538" />

### Using Template Sync

1. Go to **Actions** → **Template Sync** → **Run workflow**
2. Choose a version: `latest` (default), `master`, or a specific tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
3. Optionally enable **dry_run** to preview changes without creating a PR
4. Review and merge the created PR
5. Merge to apply updates

### What Gets Synced

**Updated:** `.claude/` (settings, CLAUDE.extra.md, statusline scripts), `.serena/`, and the sync infrastructure itself. Skills, commands, and hooks are managed by the plugin system — not template sync.

**Preserved:** Project-specific values (name, language, prompts), `settings.local.json`, gitignored files

**settings.json merge behavior:** The sync uses smart-merge semantics — your downstream `settings.json` is "master" and upstream fills gaps:
- **New keys** from upstream are added (e.g., new deny patterns, new env vars)
- **Existing values** are never overwritten (your customizations are preserved)
- **Arrays** are concatenated with deduplication (e.g., new upstream deny rules are appended)
- **Manifest variables** (`CC_MODEL`, `CC_EFFORT_LEVEL`, etc.) still override after the merge — these are your explicit choices

### Sync Exclusions

If you've removed template files you don't need, prevent sync from re-adding them:

Edit `.github/template-state.json` and add a `sync_exclusions` array:

```diff
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "upstream_repo": "serpro69/claude-toolbox",
  "template_version": "v0.2.0",
  "synced_at": "2025-01-27T10:00:00Z",
+ "sync_exclusions": [
+   ".claude/CLAUDE.extra.md",
+   ".claude/settings.json"
+ ],
  "variables": { "..." : "..." }
}
```

**Pattern syntax:**

- Patterns use glob syntax where `*` matches any characters including directory separators
- Patterns are matched against project-relative paths (e.g., `.claude/settings.json`)
- Common patterns: `.claude/CLAUDE.extra.md` (single file), `.serena/*` (entire directory)

**Behavior:**

- Excluded files are NOT added if they exist upstream but not locally
- Excluded files are NOT updated if they exist in both places
- Excluded files are NOT flagged as deleted if they exist locally but not upstream
- Excluded files appear as "Excluded" in the sync report for transparency

### Migrating from Task Master

Task Master MCP was removed in favor of native markdown-based task tracking integrated into the `plan` and `implement` skills.

The easiest way to migrate is to run the migration command in Claude Code:

```
/kk:migrate-from-taskmaster:migrate
```

It will port pending tasks, clean up TM files, update configs, and walk you through each step with confirmation prompts.

<details>
<summary>Manual migration steps</summary>

If you prefer to migrate manually, follow these steps after syncing:

1. **Port any pending tasks** to the new format: create `/docs/wip/[feature]/tasks.md` files following the [example task file](./klaude-plugin/skills/plan/example-tasks.md). Completed tasks don't need porting.

1. **Remove Task Master files and config:**

   ```bash
   rm -rf .taskmaster
   rm -rf .claude/commands/tm
   rm -f .claude/TM_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md
   rm -f .claude/agents/task-orchestrator.md
   rm -f .claude/agents/task-executor.md
   rm -f .claude/agents/task-checker.md
   ```

3. **Remove Task Master from `~/.claude.json`:** delete the `task-master-ai` entry from your `mcpServers` config.

4. **Remove TM variables from `.github/template-state.json`:** delete `TM_CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `TM_APPEND_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and `TM_PERMISSION_MODE` from the `variables` object.

5. **Remove TM references from `CLAUDE.md`:** delete the "Task Master Integration" and "Task Master AI Instructions" sections (including the `@./.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md` import).

6. **Update the template-sync workflow** ([why?](https://github.com/serpro69/claude-toolbox/issues/17)): the old workflow contains taskmaster-specific sync logic that will break future syncs. Run `/kk:sync-workflow:sync-workflow latest` or manually replace both files:

   ```bash
   VERSION="v0.3.0"  # or use latest tag
   curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serpro69/claude-toolbox/${VERSION}/.github/workflows/template-sync.yml" \
     -o .github/workflows/template-sync.yml
   curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serpro69/claude-toolbox/${VERSION}/.github/scripts/template-sync.sh" \
     -o .github/scripts/template-sync.sh
   chmod +x .github/scripts/template-sync.sh
   ```

Task tracking now lives in simple markdown files (`/docs/wip/[feature]/tasks.md`) created by the `plan` skill and consumed by `implement`. No external MCP server required.

</details>

### Upgrading to the Plugin System (v0.5.0+)

Skills and commands have moved from the template to the **kk** plugin:

- Skills remain unprefixed: `/plan` (annotated with `(kk)` in the menu)
- Commands are now namespaced: `/project:chain-of-verification` → `/kk:chain-of-verification:default`
- The template-sync workflow handles migration automatically on next sync
- After merging the sync PR, run `/plugin install kk@claude-toolbox`

### Adopting into Existing Repositories

You don't need to create a repo from this template to use the full configuration and sync infrastructure. Any existing repo can adopt it:

1. **Install the kk plugin** to get all skills, commands, and hooks:

   ```
   /plugin install kk@claude-toolbox
   ```

2. **Set up sync infrastructure.** Create `.github/template-state.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "schema_version": "1",
     "upstream_repo": "serpro69/claude-toolbox",
     "template_version": "v1.0.0",
     "synced_at": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
     "variables": {
       "PROJECT_NAME": "my-cool-project",
       "LANGUAGES": "go",
       "CC_MODEL": "default",
       "SERENA_INITIAL_PROMPT": ""
     }
   }
   ```

   Copy `.github/workflows/template-sync.yml` and `.github/scripts/template-sync.sh` from the [template repository](https://github.com/serpro69/claude-toolbox).

3. **Run Template Sync** from your repo's Actions tab to pull in the configuration (settings, Serena config, statusline, permissions). Review and merge the PR.

> [!TIP]
> Step 1 works standalone if you only want the skills. Steps 2-3 add the opinionated configuration and keep it in sync with upstream improvements.

## Development

### Running Tests

Tests across 5 suites cover the plugin structure, template sync/cleanup infrastructure:

```bash
# Run all test suites
for test in test/test-*.sh; do $test; done

# Run individual suites
./test/test-plugin-structure.sh  # Plugin manifest, skills, commands, hooks validation
./test/test-template-sync.sh     # template-sync.sh function tests + plugin migration
./test/test-template-cleanup.sh  # generate_manifest() tests
./test/test-claude-extra.sh      # CLAUDE.extra.md detection and auto-import
./test/test-manifest-jq.sh       # jq JSON pattern tests
```
