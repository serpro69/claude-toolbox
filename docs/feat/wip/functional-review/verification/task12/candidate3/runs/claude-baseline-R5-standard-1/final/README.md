# Workspace settings

Python 3.9+, standard library only. Run `python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests`.

This increment prepares the export-preview module. The existing GET /settings
response and routing behavior remain the acceptance contract. Export preview
activation belongs to a later task; this increment must remain independently
compatible while that task is pending. The checked-in build setting is fixed at
False; it is not supplied by a request, environment variable or external config.
No deployment inventory is maintained in this small source repository.
