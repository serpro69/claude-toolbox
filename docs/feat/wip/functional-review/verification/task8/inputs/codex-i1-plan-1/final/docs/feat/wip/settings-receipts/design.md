# Settings receipts

The UI needs trustworthy save confirmation. Client and provider are independently
released. Every merged client increment must support the current provider in
provider.py, including when enhanced_settings is false. Ordinary saves must keep
returning success after values are applied. The provider receipt is a later task.
This independent-delivery guarantee is a hard acceptance requirement.
