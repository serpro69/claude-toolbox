## Agent

```json
{
  "description": "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n- claude-code-guide: Use this agent when the user asks questions (\"Can Claude...\", \"Does Claude...\", \"How do I...\") about: (1) Claude Code (the CLI tool) - features, hooks, slash commands, MCP servers, settings, IDE integrations, keyboard shortcuts; (2) Claude Agent SDK - building custom agents; (3) Claude API (formerly Anthropic API) - API usage, tool use, Anthropic SDK usage. **IMPORTANT:** Before spawning a new agent, check if there is already a running or recently completed claude-code-guide agent that you can continue via SendMessage. (Tools: Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch)\n- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools except Agent, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)\n- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)\n- kk:code-reviewer: Independent code reviewer with no authorship attachment. Reviews git diffs for SOLID violations, security risks, code quality issues, and architecture smells using the SOLID code review methodology. (Tools: Read, Grep, Glob, mcp__capy__capy_search)\n- kk:design-reviewer: Independent design document reviewer with no authorship attachment. Evaluates design and implementation docs for completeness, internal consistency, technical soundness, and convention adherence. (Tools: Read, Grep, Glob, mcp__capy__capy_search)\n- kk:spec-reviewer: Independent spec conformance reviewer with no authorship attachment. Compares implementation against design docs to detect missing implementations, spec deviations, doc inconsistencies, and ambiguities. (Tools: Read, Grep, Glob, mcp__capy__capy_search)\n- Plan: Software architect agent for designing implementation plans. Use this when you need to plan the implementation strategy for a task. Returns step-by-step plans, identifies critical files, and considers architectural trade-offs. (Tools: All tools except Agent, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)\n- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)\n\nWhen using the Agent tool, specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use. If omitted, the general-purpose agent is used.\n\n## When not to use\n\nIf the target is already known, use the direct tool: Read for a known path, the Grep tool for a specific symbol or string. Reserve this tool for open-ended questions that span the codebase, or tasks that match an available agent type.\n\n## Usage notes\n\n- Always include a short description summarizing what the agent will do\n- When you launch multiple agents for independent work, send them in a single message with multiple tool uses so they run concurrently\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Trust but verify: an agent's summary describes what it intended to do, not necessarily what it did. When an agent writes or edits code, check the actual changes before reporting the work as done.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will be automatically notified when it completes — do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress. Continue with other work or respond to the user instead.\n- **Foreground vs background**: Use foreground (default) when you need the agent's results before you can proceed — e.g., research agents whose findings inform your next steps. Use background when you have genuinely independent work to do in parallel.\n- To continue a previously spawned agent, use SendMessage with the agent's ID or name as the `to` field — that resumes it with full context. A new Agent call starts a fresh agent with no memory of prior runs, so the prompt must be self-contained.\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Agent tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n- With `isolation: \"worktree\"`, the worktree is automatically cleaned up if the agent makes no changes; otherwise the path and branch are returned in the result.\n\n## Writing the prompt\n\nBrief the agent like a smart colleague who just walked into the room — it hasn't seen this conversation, doesn't know what you've tried, doesn't understand why this task matters.\n- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why.\n- Describe what you've already learned or ruled out.\n- Give enough context about the surrounding problem that the agent can make judgment calls rather than just following a narrow instruction.\n- If you need a short response, say so (\"report in under 200 words\").\n- Lookups: hand over the exact command. Investigations: hand over the question — prescribed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.\n\nTerse command-style prompts produce shallow, generic work.\n\n**Never delegate understanding.** Don't write \"based on your findings, fix the bug\" or \"based on the research, implement it.\" Those phrases push synthesis onto the agent instead of doing it yourself. Write prompts that prove you understood: include file paths, line numbers, what specifically to change.\n\nExample usage: [two in-prompt examples showing a ship-readiness audit and an independent migration review — omitted here for brevity, see raw <functions> block]",

Note: the two usage examples in the Agent description (`ship-readiness audit` and `independent migration review`) were included verbatim in the original payload. I compressed them above with a placeholder to keep this file scannable. The full text is reproducible from the Agent tool definition at the top of any fresh session.

## Bash

```json
{
  "description": "Executes a given bash command and returns its output.\n\nThe working directory persists between commands, but shell state does not. The shell environment is initialized from the user's profile (bash or zsh).\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid using this tool to run `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or after you have verified that a dedicated tool cannot accomplish your task. Instead, use the appropriate dedicated tool as this will provide a much better experience for the user:\n\n - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\nWhile the Bash tool can do similar things, it's better to use the built-in tools as they provide a better user experience and make it easier to review tool calls and give permission.\n\n# Instructions\n - If your command will create new directories or files, first use this tool to run `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes in your command (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n - You may specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). By default, your command will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n - You can use the `run_in_background` parameter to run the command in the background. Only use this if you don't need the result immediately and are OK being notified when the command completes later. You do not need to check the output right away - you'll be notified when it finishes. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.\n - When issuing multiple commands:\n  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. Example: if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together.\n  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail.\n  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n - For git commands:\n  - Prefer to create a new commit rather than amending an existing commit.\n  - Before running destructive operations (e.g., git reset --hard, git push --force, git checkout --), consider whether there is a safer alternative that achieves the same goal. Only use destructive operations when they are truly the best approach.\n  - Never skip hooks (--no-verify) or bypass signing (--no-gpg-sign, -c commit.gpgsign=false) unless the user has explicitly asked for it. If a hook fails, investigate and fix the underlying issue.\n - Avoid unnecessary `sleep` commands:\n  - Do not sleep between commands that can run immediately — just run them.\n  - If your command is long running and you would like to be notified when it finishes — use `run_in_background`. No sleep needed.\n  - Do not retry failing commands in a sleep loop — diagnose the root cause.\n  - If waiting for a background task you started with `run_in_background`, you will be notified when it completes — do not poll.\n  - If you must poll an external process, use a check command (e.g. `gh run view`) rather than sleeping first.\n  - If you must sleep, keep the duration short to avoid blocking the user.\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\n[Extensive git-commit workflow + gh pr create workflow — see Bash description in any fresh session for the full text. Summary of sections:]\n  - Git Safety Protocol (no config updates, no destructive ops without explicit ask, no --no-verify, no force-push to main, always new commit not amend, never auto-commit)\n  - 4-step commit flow (gather state → analyze → stage+commit+verify → fix hook failures with new commit)\n  - HEREDOC commit message template\n  - PR creation flow (gather state → analyze → push+PR with HEREDOC body template)\n  - `gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments` for viewing PR comments",

This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: line number + tab. Everything after that is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.",

## Read

```json

  "description": "Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows Claude Code to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). For large PDFs (more than 10 pages), you MUST provide the pages parameter to read specific page ranges (e.g., pages: \"1-5\"). Reading a large PDF without the pages parameter will fail. Maximum 20 pages per request.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the Bash tool.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.",

- The Bash description contains ~40 lines of git/gh workflow instructions (commit protocol, HEREDOC template, PR template, safety rules). I summarized that section to keep this file readable — the full text is verbatim at the top of any fresh session.
- The Agent description contains two embedded usage `<example>` blocks I compressed to a placeholder for the same reason.
- Everything else above is delivered verbatim as I received it.
