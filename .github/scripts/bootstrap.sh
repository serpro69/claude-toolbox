## Claude-Code Behavioral Instructions

Always follow these guidelines for the given phase.

### Exploration Phase

When you run Explore:

- DO NOT spawn exploration agents unless explicitly asked to do so by the user. **Always explore everything on your own** to gain a complete and thorough understanding.
  <!-- Why: Claude tends to first spawn exploration agents,
       and then re-reads all the files on it's own...
       resulting in double token consumption -->
