❯ Let's work on https://github.com/serpro69/claude-toolbox/issues/50
Let's do a partial plan, no need to write design or implementation
docs, but let's do the "thinking" and "polishing" part before we implement.

...

● Summary of all changes:

  1. .github/scripts/template-sync.sh — Replaced the cp in apply_substitutions()
   with a recursive smart_merge jq function. Downstream settings.json is master;
   upstream fills gaps (new keys added, arrays concat/deduped, scalars
  preserved). Manifest variable substitutions still run after to override
  managed keys.
  2. test/test-template-sync.sh — Added Section 5 with 8 test cases: scalar
  preservation, new key addition, array concat/dedupe, deny list propagation,
  nested object merge, manifest override after merge, first-time sync, empty
  array handling.
  3. README.md — Updated the settings note to explain the
  settings.json/settings.local.json split, documented the smart-merge behavior
  in the "What Gets Synced" section, updated the directory tree.

  Corroborated Findings

  (Both reviewers flagged — highest signal)

  - [.github/scripts/template-sync.sh:822-823] jq failure on corrupt downstream
  JSON silently loses customizations corroborated
    - code-reviewer (P1, 85%): If downstream settings.json has invalid JSON, jq
  fails. The && chain means set -e does NOT trigger (left side of && is exempt
  from errexit). Script continues with upstream-only template, and manifest
  substitutions overwrite it — all downstream customizations silently lost.
    - pal (MEDIUM): Flagged same issue, though incorrectly predicted a crash
  instead of silent continuation. Recommends explicit if ! jq ...; then
  log_error; fi pattern.
    - Author context: Both reviewers are correct that error handling is needed.
  The code-reviewer's analysis of bash errexit semantics is accurate (pal's is
  not — the script does NOT crash, it silently continues, which is worse). The
  pattern matches pre-existing code at line 849, so it's an inherited risk
  amplified by the new merge step. The downstream JSON would need to be corrupt
  for this to trigger — unlikely but possible (manual edits, merge conflicts).
  - [test/test-template-sync.sh] Missing test for type mismatch edge case
  corroborated
    - code-reviewer: Did not explicitly flag, but noted the merge handles type
  mismatches via the else . end fallback.
    - pal (LOW): Explicitly requested a test for when upstream has an object and
   downstream has a scalar for the same key, and for explicit null values.
    - Author context: The smart_merge function handles this correctly (falls
  through to else . end, keeping downstream's value). A test would lock in the
  behavior against future regressions.

  Code Reviewer Findings

  (code-reviewer sub-agent only — P0-P3 format)

  - [test/test-template-sync.sh:614-650] Misleading test comment (P2, 70%)
    - The "downstream scalar wins" test comment says "the smart merge doesn't
  override" but the assertion only checks the final value after manifest
  substitution (which overrides to "high" regardless). The merge correctness for
   scalars is implicitly covered by the "nested object merge (env)" test where
  env.B stays as downstream's value.
    - Author context: Valid observation. The comment is slightly misleading but
  the test does work as a regression test for the full pipeline. The env merge
  test provides the real scalar-preservation coverage.
  - [README.md:22] "Don't ask again" claim about settings.local.json (P3, 50%)
    - Claim about Claude Code writing permission grants to settings.local.json
  is about external tool behavior, not verifiable from this codebase.
    - Author context: We verified this empirically earlier in the conversation —
   the env variables from both files are merged at runtime, and the user's old
  setup (with separate allow lists in both files) worked correctly. The "don't
  ask again" behavior was stated by the user based on their experience. The
  claim is accurate.

  External Review Findings

  (pal codereview — native format)

  - [.github/scripts/template-sync.sh:845-846] Fragile .statusLine.command gsub
  on potentially null key (HIGH)
    - If statusLine or statusLine.command is null/missing, the gsub will fail
  with a jq error. The smart merge could introduce this scenario if a downstream
   user explicitly nullifies statusLine.
    - Author context: This is pre-existing code, not introduced by this diff.
  The gsub was there before. However, the smart merge does change the context
  slightly — if downstream has statusLine: null and upstream has the full
  statusLine object, the merge keeps downstream's null (downstream wins). Then
  the gsub at line 845 would fail. Pre-existing risk, slightly different trigger
   path.

  Author-Sourced Findings

  (none)

  Next Steps

  I found 4 issues (corroborated: 2, code-reviewer: 2, pal: 1, author-sourced:
  0).

  How would you like to proceed?

  1. Fix all — I'll implement all suggested fixes
  2. Fix corroborated + high severity — Address the jq error handling and add
  the type mismatch test
  3. Fix specific items — Tell me which issues to fix
  4. No changes — Review complete, no implementation needed
